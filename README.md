# 🌌 Interactive Portfolio

Welcome to my creative space! This is a visually engaging, interactive portfolio site built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases my work in automation, GUI development, and interactive design, while also serving as a platform to connect.

## 🎯 Features

- 🎨 **Real-Time Particle Animation**: A custom-built JavaScript canvas effect simulates dynamic, 3D-like particles with mouse and keyboard control (yaw, pitch, and zoom).
- 🧭 **Responsive Navigation**: Fixed top nav bar for smooth section jumps: Home, Projects, Contact, and external GitHub link.
- 📂 **Projects Section**: Highlights creations in Python, PowerShell, and GUI technologies.
- 📬 **Contact Form**: Simple and elegant form to get in touch via name, email, and message input.
- 💡 **Minimalist Styling**: Custom CSS for contrast and modern typography with hover interactions and soft UI components.
